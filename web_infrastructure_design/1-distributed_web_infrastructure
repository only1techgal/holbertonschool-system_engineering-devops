This is a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com:

1. **DNS:** Maps the domain name www.foobar.com to the load balancerâ€™s IP address.
2. **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** Distributes traffic between the two servers using Round Robin.
3. **Web Server (Nginx) on each server:** Handles HTTP requests and serves static files.
4. **Application Server on each server:** Processes dynamic requests and runs the application logic.
5. **Database (MySQL - Primary-Replica Cluster):**
   - Primary Node (Server 1) handles writes.
   - Replica Node (Server 2) handles reads and synchronizes with the Primary Node.

**Issues:**
1. **SPOF:** The load balancer can fail without redundancy.
2. **Security:** No firewall or HTTPS, making it vulnerable to attacks.
3. **No Monitoring:** No way to detect server failures or performance issues.
